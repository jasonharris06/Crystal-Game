# Crystal-Game
## Objective:
Select crystals that will sum up the to the Target Score.  If the player's score reaches over the target score the player receives a loss, but if the score equals the Target score the player receives a win.  The game restarts after one of the 2 possible conditions are met.  
## Coding Skills Utilized for Game:
- Jquery .on “click” function – Used to gather the random crystal number from the user upon clicking the desired crystal.
- Math.Floor(Math.random() * “ceiling value”) + “floor Value”) – this was used to create the Random “Target Score” number, it was also used 
to generate the random number for each crystal.
- Bootstrap to create the layout of the game
